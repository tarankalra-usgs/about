Hi I am Taran and I am writing this blog to share my experiences from two different flavors of numerical modeling. 

I would also share some of my personal thoughts on the tools that I have learnt along the way. The blog's purpose is to preserve some of my notes and may be start a conversation with a fellow modeler/computational scientist/cfd developer/cfd user.
